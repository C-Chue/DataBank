COLD EMAIL TEMPLATE FOR STUDENTS

  

Subject line: Reaching out to Emory Alum for Career Advice

  

Email Body:

  

Hi Sandy, I hope this finds you safe and well!

  

Apologies for emailing out of the blue; I came across your contact information in the Emory Alumni Database and see you have extensive experience as a Performance Improvement Consultant at EY.

  

If it’s not too much to ask, would you happen to have 15 minutes for a quick chat in the next two weeks? I’m a junior at Goizueta and am also taking Professor Smith’s D-Sci class (he’s the one who recommended I reach out to you!) 

  

From the online research I’ve done, management consultant looks like a great role for fresh grads but I’d love to talk with someone with on-the-ground experience who might be able to provide…a realistic perspective :)

Look forward to hearing from you!

  

Best regards,
