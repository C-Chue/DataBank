5 Steps to a Band 7 in IELTS Writing Task 2 
1. Understand the question. You must understand the question before you attempt to answer it. This way, youâ€™ll know exactly what the examiner is looking for. One of the biggest mistakes students make is not answering the question fully, which stops them from getting a score higher than a Band 5. To analyse the question, you must first identify the question type, then identify the keywords in the question and finally identify the instructions words. This will help you understand exactly what the examiner wants you to do with the question. 
2. Plan your answer. The students who get the highest marks in Writing Task 2 always plan their answers for up to 10 minutes. Planning helps you organise your ideas and structure your essay before you write it, saving you time and helping you produce a clear and coherent essay. 
3. Write an introduction. The introduction should tell the examiner the rest of the essay and answer the question directly. This tells the examiner that you know what you are doing straight away and helps you write your main body paragraphs. 
4. Write the main body paragraphs. This is where you give the examiner more detail. You do this by stating your main points and supporting these with explanations and relevant examples. 
5. Write a conclusion. In your conclusion, you should summarise what you already said in the rest of your essay.
