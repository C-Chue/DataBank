## Cover Letter prompts

Most cover letter prompts focus too much on the applicant rather than the company and use a single-prompt approach.

Instead, you should follow these three steps:

1. Identify the biggest challenge for the position by using the job description
2. Create an attention-grabbing hook that shows you understand the pain point and highlights your qualifications
3. Write the rest of your cover letter, keeping it within 250 words

Using this approach, your cover letter will hook the reader and demonstrate your unique ability to solve the company's pain points.

## Resume prompts

Don't just copy-paste a job description and ask ChatGPT to tailor your resume. Instead, use role prompting and follow these three steps:

1. Highlight the three most important responsibilities in the job description
2. Tailor your resume based on these responsibilities
3. List the differences between your original resume and the updated version

This method ensures your resume speaks the same language as the recruiter and hiring manager, and lets you catch "hallucinations" (or lies) from ChatGPT ðŸ‘€
