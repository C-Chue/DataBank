Pharmaceutical Engineering ：
is an interdisciplinary field that combines principles of chemical engineering,biology and phamaceutical sciences to design,develop,and manufacture pharmaceutical products and processes,The goal of pharmaceutical engineering is to ensure that safe ,effective ,and high-quality drugs are produced efficiently and at scale.

Some key Aspects of Pharmaceutical Engineering,
1.**Drug Formulation and development ** : Focuses on designing drug formulations that optimize the delivery,stability,and efficacy of the active pharmaceutical ingredient.
2.Process Devlopment :Involes scaling up laboratory processes to industrialscale production,ensuring that the manufacturing process is efficient,consistent and cost-effective.
3.Quality Control and Assurance : Ensures that the  final pharmaceutical product meets all regulatory standards for sagfety ,and quality through rigorous testing and validation.
4.Regulatory Compliance: Understanding and adhering to regulations set by agencies like the FDA(U.S. Food and Drug Administration ) and EMA (European Medicines Agency ) to ensure that all pharmaceutical products are safe for human use.
