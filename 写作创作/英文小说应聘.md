 Ideally, the stories you write will be intertwined in some way – however, this too is not a requirement.
The main requirements for your story will be that it is set in your native/adopted country and (for 2024) one character in the story is between the ages of 35 and 50.
The story is published online in instalments over the course of a month and then included in a print [anthology](https://www.amazon.com/stores/Henry-Whittlesey/author/B00CVZQZ5Q) at the end of the year.
The project we are currently preparing for 2024 is a continuation of the transadapatation series published since 2020.
You must compose a story of 3,000-5,000 words.
