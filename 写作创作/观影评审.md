	Special thanks to ANFFF for their continued support in exploring issues such as human-animal harmony and the environment, which makes us think about the possibilities of coexisting with different creatures on this planet. I was first introduced to the themes that ANFFF wanted to explore by Andrea Florence's documentary There 's a chinese official Channel "CCTV-9" which was partnered with National Geographic for the screening of "In the Womb: Extreme Animals". Extreme Animals". All this year being though, what I remembered is the first hot summer vacation of my secondary school years, but through the excellent documentary film, I was able to explore the secret about how the animals cleverly get along with the nature. After this experience, I adopted two cats after work, I often go to observe their personal preferences, such as what they like to eat, what their habits are like? Do they like the space we live together? And so on. When I came across ANFFF again, I realised that I had more patience to spend time with animals and plants, and to explore our lives in the same space, inspired by the excellent documentaries of my childhood, and I sincerely hope that more people can think, discuss and pay attention to this topic in the same way. After all, we are not only the only creatures on this lovely planet, but we should also take the initiative to take responsibility for the many quality resources given to us by the Blue Planet.Last but not least, the slogan of ANFFF "Every contribution, big or small, is Last but not least, the slogan of ANFFF "Every contribution, big or small, is valuable." gave me the courage to take this step to participate in the preliminary examination.

1. Your understanding and observation of the current state of animal ecology in the world/China (100 words or less) 您对于世界/中国动物生态现状的理解和观察（100字以内）
首先我想到的是我们仍然任重而道远，特别是在中国。中国的东部，人群密聚，虽然经济发达人们也设立许多动物救助站或公益动物救助组织，但是很多城市规定划在大型恶犬范围内的狗是不允许出现在城区的。只是这一个简单粗暴的规定就不难看出，1.普通大众认知仍然需要进行普及如何正确与动物和谐相处。2.国家/城市在立法或管理规定上需要更加鼓励人与动物的和谐相处，而不是一味压迫动物的生存环境。3.城市快速发展经济的时候，也应当适当发展与之匹配的生态和谐环境。

《BBC纪录片：绿色星球》
人类活动引发的一场大火毁了建造在植物土壤之上的城市，与之同时，点缀着城市的植物也捉住了重新占领城市的机会。在中国南部潮湿的气候下，有裂缝的地方就有绿色，植物高明的生存之道在存在于原始的森林，也存在于生活的城市里。生活在这迷人的绿色星球，植物永远可以是人类的盟友。绿色星球的製作團隊使用高端顯微鏡，带我们探索不经人类察觉的植物世界的运作，震撼人心的同时也能让人意识到作为人类的有限性。所以，当然可以留些许缝隙，去观察去了解，与我们一起建造这可爱星球的植物朋友。
<BBC:The Green Planet>
While a fire caused by human activity destroys a city built on plant soil, the plants that adorn it seize the opportunity to reoccupy it. In the humid climate of southern China, where there are crevices, there is green, and plants have a brilliant way of surviving in the pristine forests as well as in the cities where they live. Living on this fascinating green planet, plants can always be an ally to humans. Using high-end microscopy, the Green Planet production team takes us on a journey to explore the workings of the plant world unseen by humans, striking and at the same time able to make one realise how limited we are as human beings. So, of course, it is possible to leave some gaps to observe and understand, the plant friends with whom we build this lovely planet.

《The Cove》
《海豚湾》通过集中将观众及影片聚焦在少数几位人对于日本太地町发生海豚屠杀行为作出长期抗争的故事，给影片的观看者强烈输出表达了反对太地町渔民猎杀海豚的行为。
诚然，该纪录片能够唤来更多人关注海豚驱逐集中猎杀的事件关注，也能够使得当地民众意识到，中小学生免费午餐中的海豚肉背后的供应利益链条。离开时代、社会、历史原因和现实环境进行言论压倒性批判，更多像是通过说服的艺术和选择性摆事实的观念灌输。中国文化艺术中讲究留白的艺术，电影不该力证某人行为正确性而存在。

By putting the audience and the film in the spotlight on the story of a few people who have been fighting for a long time against the dolphin slaughter in Taiji, Japan, Dolphin Cove has given a strong output to the viewers of the film to express their opposition to the dolphin hunting by the fishermen in Taiji. 
It is certainly possible for the film to draw more people's attention to the incident of dolphin expulsion and centralised hunting, as well as to make the local people aware of the chain of interests behind the supply of dolphin meat in the free lunches for primary and secondary school students. Overwhelming criticism of speech without regard to the times, society, historical reasons and realities is more like indoctrination through the art of persuasion and selective presentation of facts. Chinese culture and art are preoccupied with the art of omission, and films should not exist to prove the correctness of someone's behaviour.

8. Is it possible for you to attend the opening ceremony in London as well as the film festival series? 是否有可能出席9月份伦敦开幕式以及影展系列活动

该问题回答不影响初审评委决策，影节不报销差旅费用，但您会作为特邀嘉宾参与影节活动。 
The answer to this question does not affect the selection of the preliminary jury. The festival does not reimburse travel expenses but offers you the opportunity to attend festival events as VIP guests.
如果能够提前2个月左右收到正式通知我被邀请，我将有时间合理安排我的签证以及相关出行准备，我很高兴将有机会在现场与大家相见。
9. Other materials that may prove your ability. 其他补充能力证明材料
Actually ，可以从我的CV当中了解到，我在Medical 行业IVD公司从事相关工作。这份工作让我有更多机会医疗相关的部分。我曾带家里毛孩子看医生，还是会被中国医疗的区别所震惊。人类医学的发展的进程中，动物为我们的医疗发展的迈进做出了十分多的贡献，可以不夸张的说，我们现在能够吃到的药，清晰的疾病成因及疾病诱因等等，都对亏了动物实验环节，他们代替了我们做了许多。当我发现， 动物医学的治疗手段那么宽泛，完全落后于人类医学治疗手段时，我承认被这样的事实震惊到了。因此，相信我本职的工作经历也能够为这次的film festival fury work 提供一些不同的角度。
