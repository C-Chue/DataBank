"Hello, my name is CHARLENE CHUE, and I am delighted to be here to discuss the opportunity to contribute to the Animal Film Festival as a pre-selector. With a solid foundation in the health industry, where I have spent seven years honing my analytical and evaluative skills, I believe I can bring a valuable perspective to the film selection process.

In my professional career, I have developed a keen eye for detail and the ability to critically assess complex informationâ€”skills that are crucial for evaluating films effectively. Additionally, my recent experience in a Diagnogic  company has further enhanced my ability to communicate insights clearly and make well-informed decisions.

Beyond my professional experience, I am deeply passionate about animal welfare. As a pet owner who has cared for two cats, I have experienced firsthand the remarkable ways animals communicate their needs and emotions without using human language. My cats have taught me that animals possess an innate ability to convey their feelings through sounds, movements, and behaviors, demonstrating their intelligence and emotional depth. This personal connection has strengthened my commitment to advocating for animal rights and environmental sustainability.

I see this role as a unique opportunity to combine my analytical expertise with my dedication to making a positive impact on animal welfare through compelling storytelling. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to the ANFFF by helping to select films that not only engage audiences but also inspire action towards a more compassionate world."
