文章的作者是在葡萄牙天主教波尔图商学院研究人格与领导力，同时担任《人格与个体差异》和《领导力心理学》杂志的副主编。他在文章中提出了ChatGPT在他进行学术写作中，起到了非常重要帮助。小编下面主要将文章中的ChatGPT指令提取了出来，如果需要获取该文章全文，可以在本文末尾获取。

**指令①：**I’m writing a paper on [topic] for a leading [discipline] academic journal. What I tried to say in the following section is [specific point]. Please rephrase it for clarity, coherence and conciseness, ensuring each paragraph flows into the next. Remove jargon. Use a professional tone.

**翻译：**我正在为一份顶尖【学科】学术期刊写一篇关于【主题】的论文。我在以下部分中试图表达的是【具体点】。请重新措辞，使其更加清晰、连贯和简洁，确保每个段落之间的流畅衔接。去掉术语。使用专业的语气。

**指令②：**Assume you’re an expert and seasoned scholar with 20+ years of academic experience in [field]. On the basis of my summary of a paper in [field], where the main focus is on [general topic], provide a detailed review of this paper, in the following order: 1) briefly discuss its core content; 2) identify its limitations; and 3) explain the significance of each limitation in order of importance. Maintain a concise and professional tone throughout.

**翻译：**假设你是一个拥有20多年学术经验的领域专家和资深学者。基于我对【领域】中一篇以【一般主题】为主要焦点的论文的总结，提供一份详细的评审，顺序如下：（1）简要讨论其核心内容；（2）指出其局限性；（3）解释每个局限性的意义并按重要性排序。始终保持简洁和专业的语气。

**第一次开启话题：**
For example, you might write: “I’m writing a paper on [topic] for a leading [discipline] academic journal. What I tried to say in the following section is [specific point]. Please rephrase it for clarity, coherence and conciseness, ensuring each paragraph flows into the next. Remove jargon. Use a professional tone.” You can use the same technique again later on, to clarify your responses to reviewer comments.
**改进：**
 If something doesn’t quite hit the mark, don’t hesitate to say, “This isn’t quite what I meant. Let’s adjust this part.” Or you can commend its improvements: “This is much clearer, but let’s tweak the ending for a stronger transition to the next section.”

**Elevating peer review提升同行评审**
For example, you might instruct the AI: **“Assume you’re an expert and seasoned scholar with 20+ years of academic experience in [field]. On the basis of my summary of a paper in [field], where the main focus is on [general topic], provide a detailed review of this paper, in the following order: 1) briefly discuss its core content; 2) identify its limitations; and 3) explain the significance of each limitation in order of importance. Maintain a concise and professional tone throughout.”**

**Optimizing editorial feedback优化编辑反馈**
For instance, after evaluating a paper and noting its pros and cons, I might feed these into ChatGPT and get it to draft a suitable letter:  **“On the basis of these notes, draft a letter to the author. Highlight the manuscript’s key issues and clearly explain why the manuscript, despite its interesting topic, might not provide a substantial enough advancement to merit publication. Avoid jargon. Be direct. Maintain a professional and respectful tone throughout.”**  Again, it might take a few iterations to get the tone and content just right.


There is no doubt that generative AI presents challenges to the scientific community. But it can also enhance the quality of our work. These tools can bolster our capabilities in writing, reviewing and editing. They preserve the essence of scientific inquiry — curiosity, critical thinking and innovation — while improving how we communicate our research.
